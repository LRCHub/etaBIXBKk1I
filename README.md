```lrc
[00:14.12] Y'all know me, still the same O.G
[00:16.15] But I been low-key
[00:17.36] Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese
[00:19.71] No deals and no G's
[00:21.15] No wheels and no keys, no boats
[00:23.05] No snowmobiles, and no skis
[00:24.83] Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford
[00:26.68] To provide my family with groceries
[00:44.18] 
[00:28.44] Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
[00:31.09] To add to the wall, full of plaques
[00:32.92] Hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
[00:35.54] Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze, hoe please
[00:38.28] You better bow down on both knees
[00:40.05] Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
[00:41.93] Who you think brought you the oldies?
[00:43.73] Eazy-E's, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C's
[00:46.38] The Snoop D-O-double-G's
[00:47.65] And the group that said, "Motherfuck the police"
[01:11.65] 
[00:49.95] Gave you a tape full of dope beats
[00:51.67] To bump when you stroll through in your hood
[00:53.42] And when your album sales wasn't doing too good
[00:55.21] Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
[00:57.11] Y'all better listen up closely
[00:58.84] All you niggas that said that I turned pop
[01:00.66] Or The Firm flopped
[01:01.72] Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep
[01:30.22] 
[01:04.32] So fuck y'all, all of y'all
[01:06.13] If y'all don't like me, blow me
[01:07.91] Y'all are gonna keep fucking around with me
[01:09.77] And turn me back to the old me
[01:24.77] 
[01:11.72] Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
[01:14.24] But nothing comes out when they move their lips
[01:15.93] Just a bunch of gibberish
[01:16.98] And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
[01:40.98] 
[01:18.95] Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
[01:21.39] But nothing comes out when they move their lips
[01:23.04] Just a bunch of gibberish
[01:24.19] And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
[01:48.19] 
[01:25.87] So what do you say to somebody you hate?
[01:27.48] Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way
[01:29.38] Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
[01:31.00] Then just study a tape of N.W.A
[01:33.13] One day, I was walking by
[01:34.67] With a Walkman on
[01:35.66] When I caught a guy
[01:36.66] Give me an awkward eye
[01:37.41] And I strangled him up in the parking lot
[01:39.14] With his Karl Kani
[01:48.14] 
[01:40.12] I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
[01:41.87] I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
[01:43.51] When I'm drunk as fuck
[01:44.85] Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
[01:47.28] Hopping out with two broken legs
[01:48.93] Trying to walk it off
[01:50.29] Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
[01:51.65] I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfucking barking dogs
[02:20.65] 
[01:54.66] And when the cops came through
[01:55.81] Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
[01:57.88] With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
[01:59.97] And still weren't found out
[02:01.39] From here on out it's the Chronic II
[02:03.51] Starting today and tomorrow's anew
[02:05.30] And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
[02:40.30] 
[02:08.72] Slim Shady, hotter then a set of twin babies
[02:11.50] In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
[02:13.56] When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
[02:15.72] Calling men ladies, sorry, Doc, but I been crazy
[02:18.94] There's no way that you can save me
[02:20.66] It's okay, go with him Hailie
[02:35.16] 
[02:23.30] Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
[02:25.71] But nothing comes out when they move their lips
[02:27.54] Just a bunch of gibberish
[02:28.50] And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
[02:52.50] 
[02:30.54] Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
[02:32.93] But nothing comes out when they move their lips
[02:34.77] Just a bunch of gibberish
[02:35.81] And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
[02:59.81] 
[02:37.13] If it was up to me
[02:38.23] You motherfuckers would stop coming up to me
[02:39.63] With your hands out looking up to me
[02:41.31] Like you want something free
[02:42.54] When my last CD was out
[02:43.68] You wasn't bumping me
[02:44.60] But now that I got this little company
[02:46.38] Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
[02:48.58] But you won't get a crumb from me
[02:50.05] 'Cause I'm from the streets of Compton
[03:09.05] 
[02:51.94] I told 'em all, all them little gangstas
[02:53.89] Who you think helped mold 'em all?
[02:55.04] Now you wanna run around talking 'bout guns
[02:56.71] Like I ain't got none
[02:57.79] What you think I sold 'em all?
[02:59.15] 'Cause I stay well off
[02:59.92] Now all I get is hate mail all day
[03:01.32] Saying, "Dre fell off"?
[03:02.74] What? 'Cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
[03:04.58] Tryin' to get this damn label off
[03:21.08] 
[03:06.04] I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath
[03:08.78] It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
[03:10.54] So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap
[03:12.44] You can have it back
[03:13.79] So where's all the Mad Rappers at?
[03:15.39] It's like a jungle in this habitat
[03:16.95] But all you savage cats
[03:17.84] Know that I was strapped with gats
[03:19.01] While you were cuddling a Cabbage Patch
[03:38.51] 
[03:20.63] Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
[03:23.16] But nothing comes out when they move their lips
[03:24.95] Just a bunch of gibberish
[03:26.05] And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
[03:50.05] 
[03:27.90] Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
[03:30.56] But nothing comes out when they move their lips
[03:32.00] Just a bunch of gibberish
[03:33.29] And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
[03:57.29] 
[03:35.26] Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
[03:37.68] But nothing comes out when they move their lips
[03:39.47] Just a bunch of gibberish
[03:40.32] And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
